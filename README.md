# Cfria
Cfria - Student's implementation of C standard library. It is for practice, simplicity and readability code in C. When I tried to find GCC source code (or any other compiler) I was overwhelmed by the amount of overhead that is necessary to write a compiler. 

## Why?
I finished K&R. I love C. It's my second favorite language after Golang. The book is amazing because anyway you will implement half of these during the book.

## Headers
| Header  | Description | Status|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| a_assert.h  |  Conditionally compiled macro that compares its argument to zero   | 0%|
| a_complex.h  | Complex numbers  | 0%|
| a_ctype.h  |  Functions to determine the type contained in character data   | 0%|
| a_errno.h  |  Macros reporting error conditions   | 0%|
| a_float.h  |  Limits of floating-piont types   | 0%|
| a_limits.h  |  Ranges of integer types| 0%|
| a_math.h  |  Common mathematics functions (I might add matrix algos)  | 0%|
| a_stdio.h  | IO headers  | 0%|
| a_stdlib.h  |  General utilities: memory management, program utilities, string conversions, random numbers, algorithms   | 0%|
| a_string.h  |  String handling   | 0%|

I will not implement any OS stuff, I am not there yet. But for now, implement these is feasible and possible.

## Compatibility and Toolchain
- All of the code will be tested on GNU/Linux Pop_OS
- The compiler I will use will be GCC with `-Wall -ansi -pedantic` flags.

## License
I use GCC so it's GPL v3. If I can use any other license (public domain) HMU.
